# ChatBot

This is an intent based chatbot. The bot is in python and the model parameters are tuning using [keras tuner](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-tuner).

The model is currently trained on a small number of [intents](intents.json).

### [Intents](intents.json)

The intents file is divided into:
1. tags: class name
2. patterns: example of users chat
3. responses: response of the bot
